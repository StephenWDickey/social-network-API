## Description 


This week's challenge features the back-end work for a social network!

In this project, users are populated using a MongoDB database, and each user can post 'Thoughts' that other users can post 'Reactions' too. 

Users can also add other users to their friend list.

You can see all CRUD operations in the video tjhat I post for the project.
